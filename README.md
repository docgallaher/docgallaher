- 👋 Hi, I’m @docgallaher
- 👀 I’m interested in upping my data analysis game and wrap my head around Github and related tools. I have extensive experience with regressions, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. But want to learn more about integrating machine learning with those tools. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and the process of updating and saving code through GitHub, Azure, and Visual Studio code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on climate change, circular economy, and environmental impact projects
